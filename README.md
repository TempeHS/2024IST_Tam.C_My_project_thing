# Overview

My game is mostly set in a dungeon, you play as a samurai that attempts at exploring the dungeon. The game includes platforming levels and levels with various enemies that will challenge the player. The main goal is for the player to make it to the end of the dungeon and defeat the final boss.

# Player Documentation
Firstly I began creating my game by adding a simple 2player movement script by watching unity video on youtube (https://youtu.be/K1xZ-rycYY8?si=hQU97qfS5Knebm4z). Next I added a script for a better jump making the jumping feel less like floating in the game. Furthermore I implemented a dash to the player by adding more code to my player movement script (https://youtu.be/7KiK0Aqtmzc?si=0CinnyL5Azhwqg9t). Next I added an animation to my player by using the sprites that my partner gave me and watching a video on animating in unity 2D (https://youtu.be/hkaysu1Z-N8?si=OgkwQxhah2OFnMpF). Finally I added the floor and background to my game using a tilemap and by following tutorials. Tilemap: (https://youtu.be/g83_gwEO0kM?si=N84ToQfKPZaxJk0b)
